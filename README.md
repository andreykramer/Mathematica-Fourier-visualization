# Mathematica-Fourier-visualization
A Wolfram Mathematica notebook inspired by the 3Blue1Brown video [*"But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction."*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)

It shows a 3Hz plot, its wrapped form on the complex plane (where you can use a slider to see how it looks with different frequencies) and finally the plot of its Fourier Transform where you can see the peak on the 3Hz frequency.
